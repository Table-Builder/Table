# Welcome to Table Builder

---

## Objective:

-   to create an app that helps to stay organised by allowing the user to create, modify and stores data in table format

---

## Currently working on:

-   **Don't forget to npm i**
-   **Create a db called 'table_builder'**
-   This is going to be a very large update. Pretty much here is what has been done:

1. Changed schema: I am addding a Notebook model in base the user wants to have multiple data sets

-   User has many Notebooks (User 1==>many Notebook), Notebook 1==>many Table, Table 1==>many Note

2. Create the database
3. Create the models:

-   ~~User~~
-   Notebook
-   ~~Table~~
-   ~~Note~~

4. Seed data:

-   User
-   Notebook
-   Table
-   ~~Note~~

## To-Do list:

-   Basic server
-   Router for backend
-   Database
-   Frontend

---

## For the future:

-   Movable entries on the table
-   User auth
-   Saving
-   Nice UI
-   Deploy
-   Admin tools
